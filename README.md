Used AssemblyAI API for audio and video transcription and Sumy Library Utilized for text summarization. And Stremlit as the framework for building the web application's user interface.
I used the AssemblyAI API to transcribe audio and video. Users can upload local files for transcription, making it available in text form. They can get subtitles they can directly upload in a modern media player like VLC. In addition, it provides a summary of the transcript, which is done by using Python's summy library. You can export this (Transcriptions, Subtitles, Summary) as TXT. There are a lot of improvements and features that can be added, like translating, uploading Youtube videos, etc. You're welcome to contribute and make suggestions. Have fun...
